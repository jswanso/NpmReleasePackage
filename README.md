# NPM Release Package

This project is to test out publishing an NPM package to GitHub.

This sample was taken from [Quickstart for GitHub Packages](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/quickstart).

## Used Windows Commands

As part of the quickstart guide I had to use some additional commands instead of creating things from hand.

### .npmrc File Creation

Commands to create the .npmrc file

`npm config set @jswanso:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com`

`mv C:\Users\<User Name>\.npmrc .npmrc`
